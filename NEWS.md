# rphylopic 1.2.0

* added text argument to get_attribution (#56)
* get_attribution now handles multiple uuids
* added browse_phylopic function (#60)
* added preview argument to get_phylopic (#59)
* switched to {maps} package in base R advanced vignette
* geom_phylopic now properly handles a single unlisted image object passed to the "img" parameter (#75)
* added filter (license) argument to get_uuid, pick_phylo, add_phylopic_base, add_phylopic, and geom_phylopic (#72)
* added img argument to get_uuid and get_attribution
* added verbose argument (calls get_attribution) to geom_phylopic, add_phylopic, and add_phylopic_base (#71)
* split out the functionality of the color argument/aesthetic to color (silhouette outline) and fill (silhouette) arguments/aesthetics in add_phylopic, geom_phylopic, and add_phylopic_base (#58)

# rphylopic 1.0.0

* rphylopic has now been transferred to the Palaeoverse community (new maintainer: William Gearty and author: Lewis Jones)
* The package has been updated to work with PhyloPic API ver. >=2.1.1
* The package has been reworked to its core functionality of fetching silhouettes and plotting them in base R and ggplot2:
  * get_uuid: this function enables users to get uuid(s) associated with a taxonomic name (new function)
  * get_phylopic: this function enables users to get the PhyloPic silhouette associated with a specific uuid (replaces image_get)
  * pick_phylopic: this function enables users to pick specific PhyloPic silhouettes when multiple are available for a given taxonomic name (new function)
  * add_phylopic_base: this function retains it's core functionality and is used to add a silhouette to a base R plot (updated from add_phylopic_base)
  * add_phylopic: this function retains it's core functionality and is used to add a silhouette to a ggplot2 (updated from add_phylopic)
  * get_attribution: this function enables users to get the attribution data associated with a specific uuid (new function)
  * save_phylopic: this function enables users to save PhyloPic silhouettes using various formats (replaces save_png)
