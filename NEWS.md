  * pick_phylopic: this function enables users to pick specific PhyloPic silhouettes when multiple are available for a given taxonomic name (new function)
  * add_phylopic_base: this function retains it's core functionality and is used to add a silhouette to a base R plot (updated from add_phylopic_base)
  * add_phylopic: this function retains it's core functionality and is used to add a silhouette to a ggplot2 (updated from add_phylopic)
  * get_attribution: this function enables users to get the attribution data associated with a specific uuid (new function)
