\title{Pick a PhyloPic image from available options}
\usage{
pick_phylopic(name = NULL, n = 5, auto = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{\code{character}. A taxonomic name. Different taxonomic levels
are supported (e.g. species, genus, family).}

\item{n}{\code{numeric}. How many uuids should be viewed? Depending on the
requested \code{name}, multiple silhouettes may exist. If \code{n} exceeds the
number of available images, all available uuids will be returned.
Defaults to 5.}

\item{auto}{\code{numeric}. This argument allows the user to automate input
into the menu choice. If the input value is \code{1}, requested images will be
automatically cycled through with the final image returned. If the input
value is \code{2}, the first returned image will be selected. If \code{NULL}
(default), the user must interactively respond to the called menu.}
}
\value{
A \link[grImport2:Picture-class]{Picture} object is returned. The uuid
of the selected image is saved as the "uuid" attribute of the returned
object and is also printed to console.
}
\description{
This function provides a visually interactive way to pick an image and
valid uuid for an input taxonomic name. As multiple silhouettes can exist
for each species in PhyloPic, this function is useful for choosing the
right image/uuid for the user.
}
\details{
This function allows the user to visually select the desired image
from a pool of silhouettes available for the input \code{name}.
