\title{Get a PhyloPic uuid}
\usage{
get_uuid(name = NULL, img = NULL, n = 1, filter = NULL, url = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{\code{character}. A taxonomic name. Various taxonomic levels
are supported (e.g. species, genus, family). NULL can also be supplied
which will skip the taxonomic filtering of the PhyloPic database.}

\item{img}{A \link[grImport2:Picture-class]{Picture} or png array object from
\code{\link[=get_phylopic]{get_phylopic()}}. A list of these objects can also be supplied. If \code{img}
is supplied, \code{name} and \code{n} are ignored. Defaults to NULL.}

\item{n}{\code{numeric}. How many uuids should be returned? Depending on
the requested \code{name}, multiple silhouettes might exist. If \code{n} exceeds
the number of available images, all available uuids will be returned.
This argument defaults to 1.}

\item{filter}{\code{character}. Filter uuid(s) by usage license. Use "by" to
limit results to image uuids which do not require attribution, "nc" for
image uuids which allow commercial usage, and "sa" for image uuids without
a ShareAlike clause. The user can also combine these filters as a vector.}

\item{url}{\code{logical}. If \code{FALSE} (default), only the uuid is
returned. If \code{TRUE}, a valid PhyloPic image url of the uuid is
returned.}
}
\value{
A \code{character} vector of a valid PhyloPic uuid or svg image
url.
}
\description{
This function provides a convenient way to obtain a valid uuid or image url
for an input taxonomic name. As multiple silhouettes can exist for each
species in PhyloPic, this function extracts the primary image.
}
\details{
This function returns uuid(s) or image url (svg) for an input
\code{name}. If a specific image is desired, the user can make use of
\link{pick_phylopic} to visually select the desired uuid/url.
}
\examples{
uuid <- get_uuid(name = "Acropora cervicornis")
uuid <- get_uuid(name = "Dinosauria", n = 5, url = TRUE)
}
