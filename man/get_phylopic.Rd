\title{Retrieve an image for a given PhyloPic uuid}
\usage{
get_phylopic(uuid = NULL, format = "vector")
}
\arguments{
\item{uuid}{A PhyloPic image uuid.}

\item{format}{Format of the image. To return a vectorized image, use
"vector". To return a rasterized image, use one of 512, 1024, or 1536.
Rasterized thumbnails can be returned by using 64, 128, or 192. Finally,
using "twitter" will return a rasterized image that includes the PhyloPic
logo and is formatted for posting on social media.}
}
\value{
If \code{format} is "vector", a \link[grImport2:Picture-class]{Picture}
object is returned. Otherwise, a png array representing the rasterized
image is returned. Either way, the uuid and download url are included as
the "uuid" and "url" attributes, respectively.
}
\description{
This retrieves a PhyloPic silhouette as a vectorized or rasterized object.
